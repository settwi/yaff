# `yaff` examples--sorted by complexity

This folder has a handful of examples of applying `yaff` to various X-ray instruments.

The complexity of each fit varies quite a bit.
Some are straightforward,
    where you load in the data and hit "go."
Others require adjusting the count energy/channel conversion (the gain),
    and pileup adjustment.

The notebooks here are (supposed to be)
    sorted by complexity.
The number in front indicates the complexity ranking.
